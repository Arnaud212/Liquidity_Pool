# DeFi-Liquidity-Pool

### What is this project ?

This project is a liquidity pool that allows the storage of ERC20 tokens.

### How it works ? 

We created two ERC20 custom token for this exercice : 

- HWT Token : The Hello World Token that is used to reward people who stake in our pool. This token has also it's own Liquidity Pool

- GUM Token : A second ERC20, created just for staking in our liquidity pool.

You have access to 3 Liquidity pools, with high daily reward for the training : 

- A HWT Pool : 8% daily HWT reward 
- A GUM pool : 5% daily HWT reward
- A Link pool : To Stake a real ERC20, and show the use of Chainlink Oracle to get Link price : 3 % daily HWT Reward
